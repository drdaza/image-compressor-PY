# compressor and gestion of images

### This code snippet processes files in a specified download folder. It focuses on two types of files: images and executable files. For image files (with extensions .jpg, .png, .jpeg), it compresses them, saves the compressed versions in an images folder, and deletes the original files. For executable files (with extensions .exe, .msi), it simply deletes them. 

### The code uses the PIL library for image processing and the os module for file operations. You can customize the paths of the download folder, images folder, and audio folder according to your specific directory locations.
